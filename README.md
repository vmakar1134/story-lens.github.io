## Data Storage and Sharing

- Data is **not shared with third parties**, except where required to provide core functionality (for example, cloud-based processing services).

If external services are used for processing, data is transmitted securely and only for the duration necessary to complete the request.

Any temporary data used for processing is discarded after the operation is completed.
